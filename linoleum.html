     <p>If you&rsquo;ve ever wanted to create your own stamps using your unique design, linoleum printing is a great option! The technique has been in use since the 1800s and today, there is a very large community of talented artists who are passionate about the art.</p>
  <p>You can create beautiful creations on a wide array of surfaces including paper and fabric. Just make sure you choose the right type of material as we explain in this article.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <h2>Materials - What you need</h2>
     <p>You only need a few items to get started with linoleum block printing. And once you have these, you can use them to create several designs. The only item you&rsquo;ll need to replace is the linoleum block for each new design.     </p>

     <h2>where to start</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Draw your design either on tracing paper to transfer onto the linoleum block, or draw your design directly on the block using a black pen or pencil.</li>
      <li>Once you have your design ready, start carving it out using your carving tools. Depending on the intricacy of the design, you can either use the large blades or smaller blades. </li>
      <li> After you have carved your design onto your linoleum block, apply a very thin layer of paint onto the roller and then apply it to the linoleum block, making sure to fully cover the design.</li>
  <li>Once you have applied paint to the block, carefully apply the design on your chosen surface and press the block for at least a minute, to ensure that your design has been printed properly. If you have printed your design onto a fabric, cover the fabric with another layer of fabric and iron over it for 2 minutes. This will help the design to permanently print onto the fabric.</li>
