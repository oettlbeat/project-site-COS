     <img src="img/haube_offen.jpg" class="responsive">

     <p>Remember the cotton plant-hangers which were a must have in the 70s? They're back! And with them comes a craft which not only has a lot of history but also has managed to start a world wide hype with all the different kinds of knots.</p>
     <h2>How it all started</h2>
     <p>To assume that Macrame is just a couple of knots tied together would underestimate a craft that has been around since the 13th century. The origin of Macramé is generally attributed to Arabic weavers using decorative knots to finish the loose ends of hand-woven textiles. Many years later it slowly spread throughout Europe and eventually became a common pastime for Sailors. Sailors played a large role in keeping Macramé alive and sharing the art with new lands. Knots had many practical uses aboard their ships, but decorative knot-tying kept hands and minds occupied during long voyages. Furthermore, they would sell and barter their knotted goods such as hammocks, belts and hats at port.</p>
     
     <h2>Materials - What you need</h2>
     <p>Although it might not seem that way, the materials which are used in Macrame are very diverse. But to get your foot into the craft, we recommend with the basics: some kind of wood or bamboo and a cotton string:</p>
